# Repository Settings Recommendations:

*   **Issues:** Enable issues to allow users to report bugs, suggest features, and ask questions. This fosters community engagement and helps you track and manage project tasks.
*   **Wiki:** Consider enabling the wiki to provide more detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples. This can be helpful for users who want to learn more about the project or contribute to it.
*   **Pull Requests:** Encourage pull requests to allow others to contribute code, fix bugs, and improve the project. Set up a code review process to ensure code quality and maintainability.
*   **Code Owners:** Define code owners for different parts of the project to assign responsibility and ensure that changes are reviewed by knowledgeable individuals.
*   **Branch Protection Rules:** Implement branch protection rules to prevent accidental or malicious changes to the `main` branch. This can include requiring code reviews, passing status checks, and preventing force pushes.
*   **License:** Add a license file (e.g., MIT License) to specify the terms of use and distribution for your project. This protects your intellectual property and allows others to use and contribute to your project under clear guidelines.
