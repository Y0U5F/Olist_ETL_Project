# Future Updates and Versioning:

1.  **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
    *   Use SemVer (https://semver.org/) to manage version numbers.
    *   **MAJOR version:** Increment when you make incompatible API changes.
    *   **MINOR version:** Increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
    *   **PATCH version:** Increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

2.  **Version Tagging:**
    *   Create tags for each release using the `git tag` command (e.g., `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`).
    *   Push tags to the remote repository using `git push origin v1.0.0`.

3.  **Release Notes:**
    *   Create release notes for each version, summarizing the changes and providing context for users.
    *   Include the following information in the release notes:
        *   Version number
        *   Release date
        *   List of new features
        *   List of bug fixes
        *   List of breaking changes (if any)
        *   Instructions for upgrading

4.  **Automated Releases (Optional):**
    *   Consider using GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD tool to automate the release process.
    *   This can include automatically creating tags, generating release notes, and publishing packages to a package manager.

5.  **Communication:**
    *   Communicate new releases to your users through blog posts, social media, or email.
    *   Highlight the key features and benefits of each release.
