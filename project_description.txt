# Project Description:

This project showcases an end-to-end data pipeline for Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce company, built with Python, Apache Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake. Following an ELT architecture with a Medallion layer approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold), the pipeline extracts data from PostgreSQL and CSV files, transforms it using dbt, and loads it into Snowflake. Apache Airflow orchestrates the entire process, ensuring daily data updates and reliability. Key features include 26+ automated dbt tests for data quality, a Star Schema data model for efficient querying, and a Power BI dashboard for insightful visualizations. The analysis revealed that 70% of Olist's revenue comes from Southeast Brazil and delivery time significantly impacts customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates strong data engineering skills, cloud-based data warehousing expertise, and the ability to deliver actionable business insights.
