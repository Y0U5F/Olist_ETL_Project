# `CHANGELOG.md` Management:

*   **Purpose:** A `CHANGELOG.md` file is a human-readable log of changes made to a project over time. It serves as a historical record of releases, bug fixes, new features, and other significant updates. It's crucial for:
    *   **Users:** To understand what has changed in each release and whether they need to update.
    *   **Developers:** To track the evolution of the project and understand the context behind changes.
    *   **Maintainers:** To communicate changes to the community and manage releases effectively.

*   **Template Structure:**

    *   **Detailed Descriptions:** Provide concise but informative descriptions of each change.

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Keep it human-readable:** Write in clear and concise language that is easy to understand.
    *   **Use a consistent format:** Follow a consistent structure for each release.
    *   **Update it regularly:** Update the CHANGELOG with every release.
    *   **Automate the process:** Consider using tools to automate the generation of CHANGELOG entries from commit messages (e.g., commitlint, husky).
